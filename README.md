# Arogy

This project combines a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) with a Flutter application to provide a user-friendly diagnostic tool.

## Setting Up

1. *Create a Virtual Environment:*
    bash
    python -m venv hop
    
    (Replace hop with your desired virtual environment name)
2. *Activate Virtual Environment:*
    - Refer to your operating system's instructions (e.g., source hop/bin/activate for Linux/macOS or hop\Scripts\activate.bat [or] hop\Scripts\activate for Windows).
3. *Install Dependencies:*
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

## Running the Project

*Machine Learning Model (diagnoser.py):*

```bash
python diagnoser.py




./diagnoser is the ml model(logistic regression)

    single command is enough here 

    python diagnoser.py

./arogy is the flutter code

    to get all dependencies run

        flutter pb get

    to build for debug

        flutter run

        //and choose 1 for windows and vice versa
    
    to generate app for windows

        flutter build windows
    
    to generate app for android 
         
        flutter build apk
